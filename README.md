#A 2D Platformer Adventure in the Wild West

Welcome to gunSlinging, a thrilling gun-based platformer inspired by the charm of Cave Story but set in a rugged western backdrop. This solo project aims to capture the essence of classic side-scrolling adventures while introducing players to a world of dusty trails, mysterious outlaws, and strategic shootouts.

üéØ #Project Goal

gunSlinging seeks to create a simple yet engaging platformer where players can:

Explore western-themed environments filled with danger and secrets.
Encounter diverse NPCs, from wary townsfolk to menacing outlaws.
Master gun-based combat with precision aiming and strategic maneuvers.
Complete levels while uncovering pieces of a larger narrative.
üõ† Development Journey

This project has been a deep dive into the world of game development, with a focus on learning and implementing core programming principles through hands-on experience. While developing this game, I tackled numerous challenges and honed key skills, from collision handling to creating fluid movement mechanics.

Core Features & Challenges
Level Design & Environment: Creating engaging desert landscapes and hidden caverns. I balanced visual aesthetics with functional platforming, carefully placing tiles and background objects to maintain player immersion while enabling smooth navigation.
Tile-Based Collision: Perfecting the collision detection with environment tiles was tricky. Jumping and landing had to feel natural while ensuring the player's movements were responsive. I spent significant time fine-tuning this logic to give the game a solid and intuitive feel.
Pixel-Perfect Shooting Mechanics: The gun mechanics in gunSlinging are designed to be strategic yet straightforward. Players must aim and time their shots carefully, overcoming enemies and hazards. Implementing this involved creating accurate hitboxes and reactive AI behavior.
The Creative Theme & Vision

Imagine yourself in a dusty frontier town, where the horizon is lined with looming cacti and distant mesas. You, the lone gunslinger, arrive with a mission ‚Äî not just to survive but to uncover the mysteries that haunt these lands. Drawing inspiration from western folklore, the goal is to create an experience that feels like the dusty pages of an old western book brought to life with modern gameplay elements.

‚öôÔ∏è Technology & Code Breakdown

The game is built using Python and the Pygame library, focusing on creating a clean, readable codebase. The logic is split across classes, with emphasis on modular design and reusability.

Key Coding Elements
Classes for Objects: Including Player, NPCs, and Enemies, each with specific behaviors and interaction logic.
Efficient Collision Logic: Leveraging both rectangle-based and pixel-based collision checks to ensure accurate gameplay.
Object Interaction: NPCs and environment elements are interactive, using simple conditions and trigger-based events to bring life to the scenes.
Looking Forward

In the future, I aim to expand the game with additional levels, varied enemy types, and more complex puzzles. The goal is to push the narrative deeper, weaving tales of the old west into each creaking saloon door and every dusty trail.

Open for Contributions

This is a solo project, but I‚Äôm open to contributions! Feel free to submit ideas or issues if you‚Äôd like to collaborate. I‚Äôm currently facing a challenge with tile collision detection when jumping and would appreciate any input from the community.
